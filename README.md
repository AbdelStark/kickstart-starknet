# kickstart-starknet

Start your new Starknet project in one command! It will create a new folder with the name of your project and initialize it with the Starknet template, ready to be built and tested with a modern toolchain using [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) and [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/). It will also create Github actions to automatically build and test your contracts on every push.

## Pre-requisites
